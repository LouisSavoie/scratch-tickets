# Scratch Tickets

Just having some fun writing some vanilla code.

This is just a digital version of the typical scratch tickets you get in real life.

Currently, you have a lucky number and 3 numbers to try and match to it. If you get a match, that's a win, if not, it's a lose. Win / lose states not in yet tho.
